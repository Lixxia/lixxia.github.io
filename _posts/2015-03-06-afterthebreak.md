We've achieved our goal of two fixes by now. The initial [pull request](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy/pull/1007) didn't follow all of the specified instructions for contributing to the project, so after a couple of fixes another request was opened: [here](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy/pull/1010). We submitted this for issue [#910](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy/issues/910), and after a couple of small changes based on input, the request was accepted and merged!

As for our documentation [pull request](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy/pull/1009), Jodal considered it but ultimately decided it wasn't the best way to go about it. So the pull request was closed.

I still consider this great progress, as we're learning how best to communicate and contribute to an open source project. (And to follow directions and documentation while doing so). 

# Future Plans
In accordance with our timeline we want to begin work on our third issue by March 12, and have it completed by March 19. We've all been searching for another bug our enhancement, focusing more on code-based fixes now that we have a better feeling of the community and existing code base.
