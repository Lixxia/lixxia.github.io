# SD Exercise 6.1

{%highlight php startinline%}
private $employer;
private $contact_person;
private $contact_phone;

function set_employer($employ){
    $this->employer = $employ;
}

function get_employer(){
    return $this->employer;
}

function set_contact($cont){
    $this->contact_person = $cont;
}

function get_contact(){
    return $this->contact;
}

function set_contact_phone($cphone){
    $this->contact_phone = $cphone;
}

function get_contact_phone(){
    return $this->contact_phone;
} 
{%endhighlight%}

# SD Exercise 6.2

Working off the existing prototype in the code, a new constructor would be as follows:
{%highlight php startinline%}
function __construct($f, $l, $a, $c, $s, $z, $p1, $p2, $e, $t,
$bg, $in, $sh, $con, $whe, $exp, $mot, $spe, $av, $sch, $hist, 
$bd, $sd, $pubn, $myn, $privn, $pass, $status, $employer, $contact, $contact_phone) {
    ...
    $this->status = $status;
    $this->employer = $employer;
    $this->contact = $contact;
    $this->contact_phone = $contact_phone;
}
{%endhighlight%}

# SD Exercise 6.3

We would need to check if the status is set to `valid` or `invalid`, and if it is not, default it to `invalid`.

# SD Exercise 6.4

Almost all of the setters and getters I encountered in `Person.php` were unused as far as I could find. Removal should not cause any problems with testing.
