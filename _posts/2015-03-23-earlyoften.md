The release early release often mentality is quite popular. I have experience with it at my workplace, where we have daily releases to our development server, and weekly or more frequent releases to production. 

To properly utilize this strategy it's important to define a proper workflow and be constantly be aware of your requirements. If you've got several people working on one project, project organization is very important, especially if they're working with similar areas in the code base. 

While release early release often is nice sounding, it doesn't need to define the way you work. Releasing shouldn't be done just for the sake of releasing. A release should have some substance to it, a bug fix or feature. It should be well tested and you should ensure that it will integrate with the existing system properly. It's easy to fall into a mentality of frequent inconsequential releases. But it should really be release early, release often, when you need it.
