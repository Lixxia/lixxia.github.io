# Presenters
The three POSSCON presenters I intend to speak to are:
[Steve Klabnik](http://posscon.org/speakers/steve-klabnik/),[Greg DeKoenigsberg](http://posscon.org/speakers/greg-dekoenigsberg/) and [Jason Hibbets](http://posscon.org/speakers/jason-hibbets/).

I chose these individuals not specifically for their presentations, but more for their companies and positions they hold. 

# Schedule
I've been super excited for POSSCON since it was announced we were going, so I've been keeping an eye on the schedule. The idea of the different 'tracks' is interesting, but it's quite hard to choose one to focus on. 

I thought that I would mainly be attending the *Back-end* talks, but there are many subjects that interest me in *Front-end*, *Open Source*, and *Devops*. Specifically I'd like to hear more about the use of Angular, Hadoop, Docker, Vagrant and Git. I'm very interested in Cybersecurity, but I don't see my career path following it, so I'm leaning towards all of the other talks. It's so hard to choose just one!

For day 2 I'm absolutely attending the *Advanced Github* workshop, as I'm quite tired of all of the beginner talks. It's great that they're making it more approachable, but after learning the basics it's difficult to find talks that go into more detail, so here's hoping this one is good. Plus I hope they focus more on `Git` and not just Github. For the second workshop I'll probably go to the AngularJS one, or the the Openstack 101.
